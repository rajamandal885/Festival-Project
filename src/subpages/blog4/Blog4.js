        <div className="topic-j"> History of the Desert Festival Jaisalmer</div>
        <p className="desert-para"> Not many people are aware of the history or legend of the desert festival in Jaisalmer.
        The code says that Lord Krishna, ruler of the Yadav community, told Arjuna (one of the Pandavas) 
        that a successor belonging to the Yadav community would set up his kingdom on the Trikuta Hill.
        In the year 1196, the prediction made by Lord Krishna came true when Rawal Jaiswal, a descendant of the Yadav clan,
        established his kingdom in Jaisalmer. Celebrations were organized throughout the kingdom,
            and eventually, the people came to know that the prophecy had come true. 
            The festivities soon developed into a festival that is now organized every year. 
            In addition, the government started marketing the vibrant festival as an international event, drawing visitors to the Jaisalmer Desert City.
